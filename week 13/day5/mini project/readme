// This code sets up a basic server using the Express framework. 
// Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

// const express = require('express'); imports the Express framework, 
// allowing us to create an instance of the Express application.

// const app = express(); creates an instance of the Express application, which 
// represents our server.

// const path = require('path'); imports the path module, which provides utilities for 
// working with file and directory paths.

// app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true })); sets up middleware to parse the 
// request body. It enables parsing of URL-encoded data sent in the request body 
// and makes it accessible in req.body.

// let shoppingList = []; initializes an empty array called shoppingList to store items.

// app.get('/', (req, res) => { ... }); defines a route handler for the root URL ("/"). 
// When a client makes a GET request to the root URL, the server responds by sending the 
// index.html file located in the same directory as the script.

// app.post('/addItem', (req, res) => { ... }); 
// defines a route handler for the "/addItem" URL path. This handler is triggered when a 
// client makes a POST request to "/addItem". It extracts the item and amount data from 
// the request body and adds it as an object to the shoppingList array. Then it 
// redirects the client to the "/list" URL.

// app.get('/list', (req, res) => { ... }); defines a route handler for the "/list" URL 
// path. When a client makes a GET request to "/list", this handler generates an HTML 
// response dynamically based on the items in the shoppingList array. It iterates over 
// the items and generates a list of <li> elements displaying the item and its amount. 
// The response is sent back to the client with the generated HTML.

// app.listen(3000, () => { ... }); starts the server and listens for incoming requests 
// on port 3000. Once the server is running, it logs a message to the console indicating 
// that the server is running and accessible at http://localhost:3000.

// Overall, this code sets up a simple server that serves an HTML file, allows the
// client to submit a form to add items to a shopping list, and displays the shopping 
// list items when requested.
