The connect function is used to wrap the MovieList and MovieDetails components, connecting them to the Redux store. This allows them to access the state from the store and receive updates when the state changes.

mapStateToProps:
The mapStateToProps function is a callback that specifies how to map the state from the Redux store to the component's props. It takes the current state from the store as an argument and returns an object that maps specific state properties to props.
In the MovieList component, mapStateToProps maps the movies state from the Redux store to the movies prop, which is used to display the list of movies.

In the MovieDetails component, mapStateToProps maps the selectedMovie state from the Redux store to the selectedMovie prop, which is used to display the selected movie details.

Dispatching Actions:
The connect function can also accept an object of action creators as the second argument. This simplifies the process of dispatching actions from the connected component. In the MovieList component, the selectMovie action creator is passed to connect. This allows the component to dispatch the selectMovie action when the "Select" button is clicked.

In summary, the connect function is a bridge between the Redux store and React components. It connects components to the store, enabling them to access state data and dispatch actions to update the state. The mapStateToProps function maps the state from the store to component props, while the second argument of connect allows components to dispatch actions directly without manually dispatching them through dispatch(). By using connect, components can efficiently interact with the Redux store and maintain a reactive user interface that reflects the application's state changes.
