<!-- SOLUTION:

const formatDate = date => [
    'getFullYear',
    'getMonth',
    'getDate',
    'getHours',
    'getMinutes',
    'getSeconds'
].map((s, i) => `${date[s]() + (i === 1)}`.padStart(2, '0')).join``;

formatDate(new Date(2020, 6, 4, 8, 0, 0))





The given solution implements a function called formatDate. 
This function takes a date object as input and returns a string formatted according to the 
specified pattern: "YYYYMMDDHHmmSS".

Let's break down the solution step by step:

The function formatDate is declared with a parameter named date, which represents the input date object.

Inside the function, an array of method names is defined: ['getFullYear', 'getMonth', 'getDate', 'getHours', 'getMinutes', 'getSeconds']. These methods are available on JavaScript's Date object and are used to retrieve the corresponding values of the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second from the input date.
The map method is called on the array of method names. This iterates over each method name and applies a 
mapping operation.

In the mapping operation, the current method name is passed to the date object using square bracket 
notation to retrieve the corresponding value. The + operator is used to convert the value to a number. 

Additionally, for the month value (index 1), 1 is added to adjust it from zero-based to one-based.

The obtained values are then converted to strings using template literals (backticks) and concatenated with 
the empty string ('') to ensure they are treated as strings.

For each value, the padStart method is called with arguments of 2 (to ensure the string has a length of 2) 
and '0' (the character used for padding) to add leading zeros if necessary. This ensures that each value 
is represented by two digits.

The resulting array of formatted values is joined into a single string using the join method with an 
empty string as the separator. -->
